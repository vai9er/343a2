--  The "total mark" that a group earned on an assignment is the weighted sum
--  of the group's grades on the rubric items for that assignment:
--      \sum_{rubric items} [ (group's grade / out_of grade) * weight ]
--  For example, assume that an assignment is graded on correctness 
--  out of 10 with a weight of .75, and style out of 4 with a weight of .25.
--  If a group earned 8 on correctness (of the 10 that it was marked out of)
--  and 2 on style (of the 4 that it was marked out of), then their "total 
--  mark" is:
--      (8 / 10 * 0.75) + (2 / 4 * 0.25) = 0.725
--  You can calculate the grade as a percentage, by dividing the "total mark"
--  by the sum of the weights then multiplying by 100. 
--  In the above example, the sum of the weights is 0.75 + 0.25 = 1 and so
--  the grade as percentage is:
--      (0.725 / 1) * 100 = 72.5%

-- The group with ID <group_id> earned the "total mark" <mark> on the 
-- assignment for which they are a group. <released> indicates whether or 
-- not the result has been made available for the group members to see on 
-- Markus. We store the "total mark" (as defined above), not a percentage.
-- 
-- You may assume that if a group has a value for mark recorded in this
-- table, then:
--  * There is a grade recorded for every rubric item for <group_id> 
--    in the Grade table, and grading for <group_id> is considerd "complete"
--    (regardless of the relased attribute's value). 
--  * The grade was computed correctly from tables RubricItem and Grade, 
--    and is therefore consistent with those tables.
--
-- NOTE: It is possible to have a garde recorded for every rubric item 
-- for a group, without having a corresponding row in Result for the same
-- group. The "total mark" is recorded in Result when the grader deems the
-- grading "complete".
